### Features
1. New background image everyday (using Unsplash API)
2. New Quote of the Day everyday (using ZenQuotes API)
3. Deployment to AWS
### How to use it
#### Notion set-up
1. Create a [Notion integration](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. Copy the unique 'Internal Integration Token' for your integration
3. Share the required page with the integration
    - On the top right corner of the page:
        - "Share" -> "Invite" -> Your integration
#### Code set-up
1. Create a new `.env` file with the same contents as the `.env.example` file
2. Replace `your_secret_here` with the Iternal Integration Token you have copied
3. Run `list_pages.py` to get the page ID for the required page
    - It should be a string of 36 random letters and numbers, separated by 4 hyphens
4. Replace the `page_parent_id` variable in `create_page.py` with the page ID for your page
    - Scroll down to the bottom of `create_page.py`
    - Replace `TODO` with your page ID
#### Deployment
The script will be deployed onto an AWS EC2 instance, which will be started and stopped automatically by a Lambda function. The EC2 instance will be started and stopped at a specific time configured in Amazon EventBridge Events, which will then trigger the Lambda function. Once the EC2 instance has started, it will run the script as a cron job and get terminated a few minutes later, once the cron job has been completed.
##### Create an IAM policy and role to allow Lambda to start & stop EC2 instances
1. In the AWS Management Console, go to IAM -> Policies -> Create Policy
2. Click on "JSON" to us ethe JSON editor to create the policy
3. Copy and paste the following code into the editor:
'''
    {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
            "logs:CreateLogGroup",
            "logs:CreateLogStream",
            "logs:PutLogEvents"
            ],
            "Resource": "arn:aws:logs:*:*:*"
        },
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
            "ec2:Start*",
            "ec2:Stop*"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
        ]
    }
'''
4. Create the policy
5. In IAM, go to Roles -> Create role
6. Choose "AWS service" as the trusted identity and "Lambda" as the use case
7. Next, attach the policy you just created to the role
8. Click on "Next" to complete the process.
